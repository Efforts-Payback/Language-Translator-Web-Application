### 🌍 Language Translator Web Application
## 📌 Description

This is a web-based Language Translator project developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
The application is integrated with an API to provide real-time translations for almost any language supported by Google Translate.

A unique feature of this project is the Translation History, which allows users to view, copy, and reuse their previous translations easily.

## 🚀 Features

• 🌐 Translate text between multiple languages (Google-supported).
• ⚡ Real-time translation using API integration.
• 📜 History Log – saves all previous translations for reference.
• 📋 One-click Copy – copy past translations for reuse.
• 🎨 Simple and clean interface (HTML + CSS).


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

• Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

• Backend: Python (Flask/Django depending on setup)

• API: Google Translate (via deep-translator or similar library)

• Extras: Local storage / backend logic for saving translation history
